If you’re deploying a **Next.js** project on **SiteGround**, you can follow these steps for a successful deployment:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Node.js hosting**: Ensure your hosting plan on SiteGround supports Node.js.
2. **SSH access**: SiteGround supports SSH access, which you’ll need for deploying your project.
3. **Domain or Subdomain setup**: Ensure your domain or subdomain is correctly set up on SiteGround.

### Steps to Deploy Next.js on SiteGround:

#### 1. **Set Up SSH Access**
- Log in to your SiteGround account.
- Navigate to **Dev Tools** > **SSH Keys Manager** and generate a new SSH key.
- Add the key to your SSH agent on your local machine.

#### 2. **Create a Node.js Application on SiteGround**
- Go to **Site Tools** > **Dev Tools** > **Node.js**.
- Create a new **Node.js application**:
  - Choose the **path** where your Next.js app will reside (e.g., `/home/user/yourapp`).
  - Select the **Node.js version** supported by Next.js (e.g., Node.js 16.x).
  - Click **Create App**.

#### 3. **Upload Your Next.js Project to SiteGround**
There are multiple ways to upload your files, but the most efficient way is through **Git** or **FTP/SFTP**.

##### Option 1: Using Git (Recommended)
1. **Push to Git**:
   - If your project is in GitHub or another Git repository, you can use SiteGround’s **Git tool** to pull the repository directly to your server.
   - Go to **Dev Tools** > **Git** and follow the instructions to set up Git integration.
   - Once configured, clone your repository using SSH:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-nextjs-repo.git
     ```

##### Option 2: Using FTP/SFTP
1. **Use FileZilla or another FTP client**:
   - Connect to your SiteGround server using **SFTP** (with your SSH credentials).
   - Upload all your project files to the directory created in the Node.js section (`/home/user/yourapp`).

#### 4. **Install Dependencies**
Once your project files are uploaded to your SiteGround server:

1. **SSH into your server**:
   ```bash
   ssh youruser@yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Navigate to your app directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/user/yourapp
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### 5. **Build and Run Your Next.js Application**
1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start your app** in production mode:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### 6. **Run Next.js in the Background Using PM2**
To keep your app running even after you exit your SSH session, you can use **PM2**.

1. **Install PM2 globally**:
   ```bash
   npm install pm2 -g
   ```

2. **Start your app with PM2**:
   ```bash
   pm2 start npm --name "nextjs-app" -- start
   ```

3. **Save your PM2 configuration**:
   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

4. **Make sure PM2 restarts your app on server reboot**:
   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   ```

#### 7. **Set Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy (Optional)**
If you want your app to be accessible on a domain without the port (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com` instead of `https://yourdomain.com:3000`), you can configure **Nginx** as a reverse proxy.

1. **Install Nginx** (if it’s not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

2. **Configure Nginx**:
   - Edit the Nginx configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
     ```

   - Add the following configuration to forward requests to your Next.js app:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name yourdomain.com;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
             proxy_http_version 1.1;
             proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
             proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Restart Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

#### 8. **Enable SSL (Optional)**
To enable HTTPS, you can use **Let’s Encrypt SSL** in SiteGround:

- Go to **Site Tools** > **Security** > **SSL Manager** and install Let’s Encrypt SSL for your domain.
- After installation, go to **HTTPS Enforce** and enable it to redirect all traffic to HTTPS.

#### 9. **Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)**
If your Next.js app requires environment variables, you can configure them in SiteGround.

- Go to **Site Tools** > **Dev Tools** > **Node.js** and add environment variables under the **"Environment Variables"** section.

### Conclusion
SiteGround provides full Node.js hosting, which makes it an excellent platform for deploying your Next.js application. By following the steps above, you can successfully deploy your Next.js app to SiteGround and keep it running with PM2 and Nginx for production use.
